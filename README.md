# Advent of Code 2023

A starter repo for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) completed in javascript

Tested on Ubuntu & Windows with Node 20.

Run `npm ci` to install dependencies

Run `npm start` to run index.js containing each day
Run `npm run test` in a terminal to run tests

Add days by:

- duplicating the existing _src/day1_ directory and renaming to "dayx" 1) the filenames and 2) the function names
- adding a "dayx" input file within the _inputs_ directory
- adding the "dayx" function to _index.js_
